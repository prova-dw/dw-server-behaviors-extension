## Updated Version of ServerBehaviors for Dreamweaver CC+

With Dreamweaver CC and onwards, Server Behaviors, Database, Bindings, and Components are not available by default, as they were with CS6 and earlier versions of Dreamweaver. This extension restores those features and in this version is updated to support MYSQLI and PHP7.0+ for php/mysql Server.

These features are very useful when working with Dynamic websites and interacting with database systems.

### Features

With this extension it is possible to connect to the following databases:

```markdown
 - MYSQL in PHP
 - SQLServer in ASP
 - Access DB in COLDFUSION
For other details on ASP and COLDFUSION check the adobe documentation.
```

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/prova-dw/dw-server-behaviors-extension/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.
